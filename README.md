# Search Algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various search algorithms, demonstrating different approaches to searching for an element in a list. The implemented algorithms include:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Algorithms

### 1. **Linear Search**
Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list one by one, starting from the first element, until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the worst, average, and best cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. **Binary Search**
Binary Search is a more efficient search algorithm, but it only works on **sorted** lists. It divides the list into two halves and repeatedly narrows down the search space based on comparisons with the middle element.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) in all cases (best, average, and worst).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for iterative implementation or O(log n) for recursive implementation due to recursion stack.

# Installation
**Clone this repository**:
